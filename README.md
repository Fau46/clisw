# CLISW
Clisw is a CLI for <a href="https://github.com/YoyPa/isw">isw</a> program, so you must have it already.
I developed it because I change periodically the fan speed and change manually from isw config file was annoying.
This is my first python program, so feel free to suggest anythings.

# ï˜Š&nbsp; INSTALLATION 
Put clisw on bin folder and you can launch it from everywhere on the terminal

REMEMBER: You need launch it with root privileges (sudo)
